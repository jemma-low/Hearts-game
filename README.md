# Hearts :heart: (PoC)

## Description

This is an application to play a game of hearts against three computer players. See hearts rules [here](https://www.thesprucecrafts.com/hearts-complete-card-game-rules-411730). 
As this is a work in progress, the computers are very easy to beat as they make random choices since there is no strategy code.

### Motivation
This project was created to fill the void that playing [Microsoft Hearts](https://alchetron.com/Microsoft-Hearts) on Windows 7 left.

## Running the app
Currently, the application can only be run via the terminal. 
- Play normally: `bash run.sh`
- Play in debug mode i.e. you can see the computer's cards: `bash run.sh --debug`

## Packages
- [Python Arcade](https://api.arcade.academy/en/latest/get_started.html)
